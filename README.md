# Simplyuix Portfolio

A visually captivating web experience inspired by David, the Awwward site title winner. With HTML, CSS, JS, GSAP, Node.js, Vite.js, THREE.js, Blender, and Asscroll, I've created a unique journey showcasing the power of 3D and WebGL.

Through THREE.js and WebGL,I have rendered stunning 3D scenes and animations that blur the lines between reality and virtuality. GSAP adds life to our creations, infusing movement and dynamism throughout.

Utilizing Node.js and Vite.js ensures efficient development and scalability, allowing seamless access across devices and platforms. Asscroll adds elegance and smooth scrolling behavior, enhancing the overall fluidity of the experience.

This portfolio project showcases my technical prowess and commitment to continuous learning. With a diverse tech stack and advanced 3D technologies.
